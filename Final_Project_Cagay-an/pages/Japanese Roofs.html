				<p>The curvy and elongated roofs of Japanese traditional architecture are not only visually stunning but also play a crucial role in the structure of buildings. There are four main types of roofs in Japanese architecture: the gabled roof (kirizuma), hipped roof (yosemune), hip-and-gable roof (irimoya), and square pyramidal roof (hogyo). The eaves of Japanese roofs are designed to be wide in order to protect windows from the heavy rain that occurs during Japanese summers. In addition to their functional purpose, the eaves also serve as a canvas for intricate and symbolic kawara, which are traditional roof tiles of Japan. These tiles provide further protection from the rain while adding an element of beauty to the roofline. During summer rains, many Japanese people take pleasure in opening their windows to let in the fresh air and listen to the calming sound of raindrops on their well-protected roofs. The attention to detail and practicality of Japanese roof design is just one aspect of the fascinating and unique characteristics of traditional Japanese architecture.
				<br><br>
				The oldest and simplest roof style used in traditional Japanese architecture is the Kirizuma roof. This type of roof is made up of two sides connected at the ridge, and when viewed from the side, it appears to cut through the walls. While Kirizuma roofs were traditionally used in lower-class houses, they can also be found on the main tower of Japanese castles, where multiple roof styles are often combined to create a unique design. For example, the Hikone castle features Kirizuma roofs on the first floor and the elegant Japanese Karahafu on the second floor. The use of different roof styles in Japanese architecture allows for creative and visually striking designs that reflect the rich cultural heritage of Japan.
				<br><br>
				Irizuma-zukuri, one of the roof styles, indicates the style of roof with two surfaces inclining from the ridge at the top, or having the shape of a book placed with its face on the lower side. In a broad sense, this term indicates a building with any roof of this style. The term Kirizuma-yane is also used for the same meaning.
				<br><br>
				Yosemune-zukuri is a form of roof which has four sloping faces. In a broad sense, it also refers to buildings which have this type of roof. When referring to the style of roof itself it is often abbreviated to "yosemune". It is also called "shichu." In Japan it is the second most widely-used form after "kirizuma-zukuri" which has two sloping faces.
				<br><br>
				The typical structure of a yosemune-zukuri roof has four sloping faces which consist of two triangle-shape roofs at "tsumagawa" (the side vertical to the omune) and two trapezoid-shape roofs at "hiragawa" (the side parallel to the omune). As yosemune-zukuri have four-way sloping roofs, the flow of rainwater drains well compared to the kirizuma-zukuri. However, as it has no vertical plane, it is likely to be badly ventilated compared to kirizuma-zukuri or irimoya-zukuri. Also, sometimes several yosemune are combined to form roofs of a complex shape.
				<br><br>
				One of the most striking architectural features of the traditional Japanese buildings is the roof and among the various types, one that stands-out is Irimoya-zukuri, the Japanese version of what is called a “hip-and-gable” roof.
				<br><br>
				Irimoya-zukuri is a combination between the hipped and the gable roofs, combining the advantages of both types. The hipped roof gives stability to the building and it is often used in places with strong winds, while the gable roof is recommended in areas with heavy snow.
				<br><br>
				Shaped like a pyramid, Hogyo-yane is one of the types of roofs used in the Japanese traditional architecture, especially for the Buddhist constructions. When used for religious purposes, it has on top a parallelepipedic object called roban, with a double role, decorative and spiritual.</p>

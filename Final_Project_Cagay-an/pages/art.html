				<p>Art Nouveau's broad influence across architecture, design, and visual arts allows for the creation of what are known as total works of art, where every element of a structure from its windows to its door handles to its decorative flourishes can be harmonized to create an immersive Art Nouveau style.

				Art Nouveau's broad influence across architecture, design, and visual arts allows for the creation of what are known as total works of art, where every element of a structure from its windows to its door handles to its decorative flourishes can be harmonized to create an immersive Art Nouveau style. 
				<br><br>
				While Art Nouveau is mainly concentrated in Europe and in the United States, it is considered an international style. Variations of Art Nouveau are known by various names in varying countries. The term Art Nouveau first appeared in Belgium and is used in France, where offshoots of the style may also be referred to as Belle Epoque and Style Guimard. In Spain itâ€™s called Modernism, and Jugendstil (Youth Style) in Germany. In the United States Art Nouveau is often referred to as Tiffany Style, thanks to the high-profile work of Art Nouveau jeweler and glassmaker Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933), creator of the iconic Tiffany lamp.
				<br><br>
				Art Nouveau style is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation.
				<br><br>
				Common motifs include stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements. Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, stained and curved glass, and decorative wrought iron. </p>

				<p>Baroque architecture, architectural style originating in late 16th-century Italy and lasting in some regions, notably Germany and colonial South America, until the 18th century. It had its origins in the Counter-Reformation, when the Catholic Church launched an overtly emotional and sensory appeal to the faithful through art and architecture. Complex architectural plan shapes, often based on the oval, and the dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces were favoured to heighten the feeling of motion and sensuality. Other characteristic qualities include grandeur, drama and contrast (especially in lighting), curvaceousness, and an often dizzying array of rich surface treatments, twisting elements, and gilded statuary. Architects unabashedly applied bright colours and illusory, vividly painted ceilings. Outstanding practitioners in Italy included Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Carlo Maderno, Francesco Borromini, and Guarino Guarini. Classical elements subdued Baroque architecture in France. In central Europe, the Baroque arrived late but flourished in the works of such architects as the Austrian Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Its impact in Britain can be seen in the works of Christopher Wren. The late Baroque style is often referred to as Rococo or, in Spain and Spanish America, as Churrigueresque.
				<br><br>
				Baroque architecture aimed to create a sense of dynamism and movement, often achieved through the use of curved forms, undulating facades, and dramatic architectural elements. The intention was to engage and captivate the viewer.
				<br><br>
				Baroque architecture is known for its intricate and lavish ornamentation. Elaborate decorations such as intricate carvings, gilded accents, and sculptural elements were used to create a visually rich and opulent environment.
				<br><br>
				Baroque architects employed various techniques to create optical illusions and heighten the dramatic effect of their designs. These included the use of trompe-l'oeil paintings, curved surfaces, and illusionistic ceiling frescoes to give the impression of grandeur and create a sense of awe.
				<br><br>
				Baroque architects integrated sculpture into their designs, blurring the boundaries between architecture and sculpture. Sculptural elements were often incorporated into the facades, niches, and interior spaces, creating a cohesive and harmonious ensemble. It is frequently employed symbolism and allegory, conveying messages and narratives through its decorative elements. Sculptures, reliefs, and paintings were often used to communicate religious, mythological, or historical themes. Baroque architecture was not limited to Europe but spread to other parts of the world through colonization and trade. It influenced architectural styles in regions such as Latin America, where it merged with indigenous and Mesoamerican influences to create unique forms like the Churrigueresque style. </p>

				<h3>Engaged Columns</h3>

				<p>In architecture, a form of column, sometimes defined as semi or three-quarter detached according to its projection; the term implies that the column is partly attached to a pier or wall. It is rarely found in Greek work, and then only in exceptional cases, but it exists in profusion in Roman architecture. In the temples it is attached to the cella walls, repeating the columns of the peristyle, and in the theatres and amphitheatres, where they subdivided the arched openings: in all these cases engaged columns are utilized as a decorative feature, and as a rule the same proportions are maintained as if they had been isolated columns. In Romanesque work the classic proportions are no longer adhered to; the engaged column, attached to the piers, has always a special function to perform, either to support subsidiary arches, or, raised to the vault, to carry its transverse or diagonal ribs. The same constructional object is followed in the earlier Gothic styles, in which they become merged into the mouldings. Being virtually always ready made, so far as their design is concerned, they were much affected by the Italian revivalists.
				<br><br>
				Engaged columns have been utilized in various architectural styles throughout history. They are prominently featured in classical styles like Greek, Roman, and Renaissance architecture. However, they can also be found in more contemporary architectural designs, where they serve both functional and decorative purposes.
				It create an illusion of depth on the building's facade. By projecting partially from the wall, they provide a three-dimensional effect and break the monotony of flat surfaces. This architectural technique adds visual interest and complexity to the overall design.
				<br><br>
				Engaged columns often contribute to the visual hierarchy and symmetry of a building's facade. They can be used to define different levels or sections of the building, emphasizing the entrance or specific areas. The repetition of engaged columns on a building's facade creates a balanced and harmonious composition.
				It has a rich historical significance and have been used in iconic structures throughout the ages. Examples include the Parthenon in Athens, the Colosseum in Rome, and the Pantheon in Paris. Incorporating engaged columns in contemporary architecture pays homage to these historical architectural traditions.
				<br><br>
				In modern architecture, engaged columns are often reinterpreted in creative ways. While the classical style columns are typically made of stone or marble, contemporary designs may use a variety of materials such as concrete, steel, or glass. The proportions, shapes, and detailing can be adapted to suit the overall architectural concept.</p>

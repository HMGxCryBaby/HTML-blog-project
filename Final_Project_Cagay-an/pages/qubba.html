				<p>A qubba, also transliterated as ḳubba, kubbet and koubba, is a cupola or domed structure, typically a tomb or shrine in Islamic architecture. In many regions, such as North Africa, the term qubba commonly the tomb of a local wali or marabout, and usually consists of a chamber covered by a dome or pyramidal cupola.
				<br><br>
				In Islamic Architecture, most of the Mosque has one or more domes, it is called Qubba in Arabic. According to the article, “The dome appears to be a general symbol, signifying power, the royal city, the focal point of assembly; it can therefore serve both religious and secular purposes. Its outward visible appearance does not truly help us to understand, interpret or identify any building.
				<br><br>
				In the Islamic building tradition, the convoluted dome was often used. The dome is made of concave sections, from the appearance it looks like a pumpkin. The dome, in Islam, represents the vault of heaven in the same way as the garden prefigures Paradise.
				<br><br>
				The first domed was the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem built by the Arabs(691) . Timber was used in the Dome of the Rock which made the structure lighter and flexible but is suggested to be covered with copper to protect it from the weather.</p>
